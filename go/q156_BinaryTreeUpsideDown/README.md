# [156 - Binary Tree Upside Down]()
- 

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, turn the tree upside down and return the new root.

You can turn a binary tree upside down with the following steps:

1. The original left child becomes the new root.
2. The original root becomes the new right child.
3. The original right child becomes the new left child.

```bash
  x          x         y
 ↙ ↘   ⭢   ↗    ⭢  ↙ ↘
y    z     y ⭢ z    z   x
```

The mentioned steps are done level by level. It is guaranteed that every right node has a sibling (a left node with the same parent) and has no children.

 
### Example 1:

```bash
    1            1         4
   ↙ ↘   ⭢     ↗    ⭢  ↙ ↘
  2    3       2 ⭢ 3    5   2
 ↙ ↘         ↗            ↙ ↘
4    5       4 ⭢ 5        3   1

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [4,5,2,null,null,3,1]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
``` 

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 10].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10
- Every right node in the tree has a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent).
- Every right node in the tree has no children.
